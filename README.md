# Hypergraphs
This repository contains an analysis paper and corresponding presentation on hypergraphs 
and some of the ways they can be leveraged for query processing. In the database context, 
representing queries as hypergraphs creates potential opportunities for improved query 
processing. This paper provides an introductory overview of hypergraphs and their 
applications, including worst-case optimal join algorithms and hypertree decompositions.
